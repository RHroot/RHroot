## ░ About

I design systems that are deliberate, reproducible, and scalable.

Currently pursuing the IITM BS degree on an accelerated trajectory, with strong emphasis on:

- Mathematical foundations (Linear Algebra → ML)
- Infrastructure & reproducible environments
- Automation-first engineering
- Security-aware system design

I do not build for aesthetics alone.  
I build for structure, leverage, and long-term precision.

## ░ Technical Arsenal

### Languages

```
Python   C   C++   Rust   Go   Zig   Java   Lua
```

### Systems Stack

```
OS            : NixOS (Declarative Configuration)
Window Manager: Hyprland
Editor        : Neovim
Terminal      : Kitty
Workflow      : Git-driven, Reproducible, Minimal
```

## ░ Engineering Direction

- Deep mastery of linear algebra for machine learning
- Optimization thinking in real-world systems
- DevOps & infrastructure puzzle design
- Performance-conscious programming
- Scalable configuration architecture

---

## ░ Design Philosophy

```
Systems > Hacks
Depth   > Trends
Signal  > Noise
Clarity > Complexity
```

---

## ░ Operating Principle

I refine.  
I optimize.  
I remove friction.  
I build foundations that last.
